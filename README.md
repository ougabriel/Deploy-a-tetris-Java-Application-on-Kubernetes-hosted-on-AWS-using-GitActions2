# Deploy-a-tetris-Java-Application-on-Kubernetes-hosted-on-AWS-using-GitActions2

Project Name: JavaApp-Kubernetes-GitActions-AWS

**Board Layout:**

1. **Overview:**
   - Description: This project aims to automate the deployment of a Java application to Kubernetes hosted on AWS using GitActions. The Java application will be built by GitActions, and the Docker image will be pushed to DockerHub. The Kubernetes cluster will be configured with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and a service will be exposed to access the deployed application.

2. **Tasks:**
   - Task 1: Set up GitActions workflow for building and pushing Docker image
   - Task 2: Configure Kubernetes cluster on AWS
   - Task 3: Implement RBAC for Kubernetes cluster
   - Task 4: Define Kubernetes service to expose the application
   - Task 5: Create YAML manifests for Kubernetes deployment
   - Task 6: Test the deployment workflow
   - Task 7: Document the deployment process

3. **Issues:**
   - Issue 1: Docker image build failure
   - Issue 2: RBAC configuration errors on Kubernetes
   - Issue 3: Service not exposing the application correctly
   - Issue 4: Integration issues between GitActions and Kubernetes

4. **Pull Requests:**
   - PR 1: Add GitActions workflow for Docker image build
   - PR 2: Configure Kubernetes cluster and RBAC
   - PR 3: Define Kubernetes service YAML
   - PR 4: Test and document deployment process

5. **Discussions:**
   - Discussion 1: Planning deployment strategy
   - Discussion 2: Troubleshooting Docker image build issues
   - Discussion 3: RBAC configuration best practices
   - Discussion 4: Monitoring and scaling strategies for Kubernetes deployment

6. **Releases:**
   - Release 1.0: Initial deployment to Kubernetes
   - Release 1.1: Bug fixes and improvements
   - Release 1.2: Performance optimizations

7. **Wiki:**
   - Deployment Guide: Step-by-step guide for deploying the Java application to Kubernetes on AWS using GitActions
   - Troubleshooting: Common issues and solutions encountered during deployment
   - Best Practices: Recommendations for maintaining and managing the deployment environment

8. **Settings:**
   - Collaborators: Manage access for team members
   - Secrets: Store sensitive information such as DockerHub credentials and AWS configuration
   - Branches: Configure branch protection and deployment policies
